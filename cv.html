                </div>
                <p>As a junior Ruby developer at STEM Learning, I collaborate closely with the
                product team to create and implement new features on the Teach Computing
                website. My responsibilities include introducing new features, refactoring and
                updating existing code to ensure improved performance and maintainability, and
                developing dynamic and responsive front-end interfaces using JavaScript,
                Stimulus, and CSS. I have integrated third-party services into the platform, such
                as Classmarker and Credly, and maintained high standards of code quality
                through testing, code reviews, and adherence to best practices. I also manage
                application deployments via Heroku, ensuring smooth transitions across
                development, staging, and production environments.<br/><br/>
                Additionally, I conducted thorough code testing and QA using PR apps to ensure
                robust, error-free releases. I use RSpec for automated testing, achieving 96%
                code coverage to ensure the reliability and stability of the codebase. The T each
                Computing website retrieves course details from Dynamics and is closely
                integrated with the platform, a process I support with the skills gained during a
                16-week Dynamics development course. I actively participate in sprint reviews
                with stakeholders, offering updates, gathering feedback, and ensuring that the
                work aligns with business objectives.</p>
